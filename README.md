## Synopsis

This script hits the Google Maps Distance Matrix API and calculates current and average travel times between two points. The script outputs a CSV with all the pertinent information.


## Motivation

I was curious when trains passed a certain road and wanted to determine if there was any regularity to the schedule. I setup a task scheduler to run this script once a minute, all day, every day to try and determine a schedule.


## Installation

Download or fork this repo.


## API Reference

This relies heavily on the Google Maps Distance Matrix API. You will need a key (free up to 2500 requests a day).
